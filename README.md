# PathFinder

This web app shows the visualization of the very popular a-star(A\*) algorithm.

## About A\* Algorithm

A\* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost.

### f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

here n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal.

## Made using
